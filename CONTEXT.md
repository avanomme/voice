## Voice Configuration

### XTTS Speakers (50+ Complete Collection)
**International Voices**: Claribel Dervla, Andrew Chipper, Ana Florence, Damien Black, Sofia Hellen
**British Accents**: Emily, George, Charlotte, Oliver, Isabella, Eleanor, Bernard, Victoria
**Celtic Voices**: Seamus, Siobhan (Irish), Hamish, Fiona (Scottish), Rhys (Welsh)
**Professional**: Narrator, Storyteller, Professor, Guide, Host, Executive, Director
**Specialty**: Echo (AI assistant), Sage, Nova, Atlas, Luna

### Piper (Fast, Reliable) - Auto-Downloadable
- `en_GB_southern_english_female_low` - Vale (Deep British Female) - Default
- `en_GB_cori_medium` - Cori (Northern English)
- `en_GB_jenny_dioco_medium` - Jenny (Southern English)
- `en_GB_alba_medium` - Alba (Scottish)
- `en_GB_northern_english_male_medium` - Northern English Male

### Bark (Emotional Expressions)
- British speakers with [laughs], [sighs], [music] support
- 4 British voice variants (2 male, 2 female)

## Model Management

### Automated Downloading
- **Centralized Configuration**: download_models.py reads from voice_models.py
- **British Voice Focus**: All defined Piper British voices auto-downloaded
- **Progressive Loading**: Whisper â†’ Piper â†’ Coqui â†’ Bark (by size/importance)
- **Fallback Support**: Hardcoded models if configuration fails
- **System Checks**: RAM/GPU verification before large model downloads

### Voice Model Locations
- **Base Directory**: `~/.local/share/voice_models/`
- **Piper Models**: `piper/` subdirectory with .onnx and .json files
- **Coqui Cache**: Managed by TTS library
- **Bark Cache**: Managed by Bark library

## Wake Word Detection

### Features
- **Continuous Listening**: Background VAD-based audio monitoring
- **Wake Words**: "Hey Assistant", "Voice Assistant" (configurable)
- **Permission Handling**: Explicit microphone permission requests
- **Voice Activity Detection**: WebRTC VAD for efficient processing
- **Speech Processing**: Whisper-based wake word transcription

### Integration
- Web interface wake word toggle button
- Automatic conversation initiation on detection
- Permission verification before activation
- Background thread processing with minimal CPU usage

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Local-only processing** - No cloud dependencies
2. **British accent focus** - Vale-like voice preference
3. **Multi-engine approach** - Best of each TTS system
4. **GPU optimization** - Hardware-specific performance tuning
5. **Web-based UI** - Desktop browser interaction model
6. **Comprehensive voice coverage** - 50+ speakers with accent diversity
7. **WebRTC VAD wake word** - Efficient continuous listening without cloud services
8. **Centralized model management** - Single configuration source for all voice models
