## Workflow Integration

These commands are designed to work with Claude Code's slash command feature:

1. **Project Setup**: Start with `/bootstrap`
2. **Task Management**: Use `/next_task` to find what to work on
3. **Development**: Code changes, then `/lint_and_test`
4. **Testing**: Use `/test_voice` to verify functionality
5. **Iteration**: Return to `/next_task` for continuous workflow

## Voice Assistant Specific Features

- **Multi-engine TTS testing**: Tests Coqui, Bark, and Piper engines
- **Wake word validation**: Verifies continuous listening functionality
- **Error log monitoring**: Checks logging system health
- **British voice priority**: Maintains focus on UK/Irish/Australian accents
- **GPU optimization**: Considers CUDA memory usage for RTX 5060 Ti

## Configuration

Commands read from:
- `.claude/settings.json` - Project configuration
- `docs/tasks.md` - Task tracking
- `logs/` - Error and activity logs
- `src/assistant/` - Core voice modules

All commands are designed to be run from the project root directory.
